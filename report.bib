    abstract = "DANGER AND HARM ARE AVOIDED BY STRATEGIC DECISIONS MADE AT ALL
        THREE LEVELS OF THE TRIUNE FOREBRAIN: rational (neomammalian),
    emotional (paleomammalian), and instinctive (reptilian). This
        applies also to potential harm from conspecifics, which leads to
        a choice between escalating and de-escalating strategies. Anxiety
        is a component of de-escalating strategies mediated by the
        paleomammalian and reptilian forebrains. When the neomammalian
        (rational) brain fails to deal with the threat of conspecific
        danger, these more primitive de-escalating strategies may be
        activated and may present as anxiety disorders. The capacity for
        concealment of anxiety and other forms of negative affect has
        also evolved, and excessive concealment may lead to
        psychopaihology by breaking the negative feedback loop of
        excessive motivation, leading to impaired performance, leading to
        signals of distress, and leading to reduced exhortation to
        succeed on the part of parents and teachers; this situation is
        illustrated by a model based on the Yerkes-Dodson law.",

    abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;COVID-19 crisis had a huge
        impact on education and academics. Besides, it might have generated
            public fear and worry. All these factors might affect students’
            performance and wellbeing and might increase stress levels
            especially during exams.&amp;amp;nbsp; Therefore, this study will
            investigate the impact of COVID-19 crisis on student’s exam anxiety
            and its relationship with other factors. A cross-sectional study
            was conducted by distributing exam anxiety survey electronically to
            Saudi universities bachelor students, two hundred and seventy-two
            students have responded to the survey.&amp;amp;nbsp; The results
            have shown that both female and male student have high anxiety
            levels. And no significant correlation was found between any
            demographic data and anxiety level, except the gender, as female
            students have a higher anxiety level than male students. In
            conclusion, COVID-19 might had generated a high exam anxiety level,
        especially in female students. Therefore, facilitating initiatives
            might be considered to improve students’ performance during this
            crisis.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
